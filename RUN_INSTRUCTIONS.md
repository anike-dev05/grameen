# Instructions to Run the React Native Application

## Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **React Native CLI**: Install the React Native CLI globally by running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g react-native-cli
   ```
3. **Android Studio** or **Xcode**: Depending on whether you want to run the app on Android or iOS, make sure you have the respective development environment set up.

## Steps to Run the Application
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd e:\## CALOTRACK\grameen\portfolio_monitoring_app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you haven't already installed the dependencies, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     react-native run-android
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     react-native run-ios
     ```

4. **Start the Metro Bundler**:
   If it doesn't start automatically, you can start it manually by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Note
Make sure your emulator or device is running before executing the run command. If you encounter any issues, check the React Native documentation for troubleshooting tips.
